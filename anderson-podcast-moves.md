# CBS Sports Eye on College Basketball Podcast
I listened to the CBS Sports Eye on College Basketball Podcast, and the two episodes I listened to were called "2/19: Calipari call out; Bill Self should be in HOF; Virginia concerns; Michigan State bad luck" and "2/22: Is Wichita State really on the wrong side of the NCAA tourney bubble?".
## Organization
- This podcast is released three times a week, and is named with the date released and the main topics talked about in that specific episode.  (Ex: 2/19: Calipari call out; Bill Self should be in HOF; Virginia concerns; Michigan State bad luck)
- Each episode starts off with a thirteen second music introduction, then the regular host, Gary Parish introduces himself and his co-host, Matt Norlander.
- The duo did not bring in any guest speakers; it was just the two of them discussing different topics.
- While on the page to watch each podcast, there was a short description, three to five sentences long, describing what would be talked about in this episode.
- There were no outside advertisements during this podcast, however Parish does put in a shoutout to Seat Geek.  It is evident that they were paid to include this line about a specific company.
- At the bottom of the page, there were links that could be clicked to share each podcast on Facebook, Twitter Google+, and Linkdin.
- Each episode was around 40 minutes long.
## Style
- There was a music introduction that lasted about thirteen seconds to start each podcast.
- I did not hear any special sound effects were used throughout the podcast.  They seemed to be trying to be as professional sounding as possible and avoided cheesy, cartoonish sounds.
- It sounded as though Norlander was not physically in the studio with the Parish.  Norlander sounded a little more muffled when he spoke.
- Music started as he started to wrap up what he was saying, about 25 seconds before the end of the podcast, and the last thirteen seconds just consisted of the music playing.

## Narrative Types
#### 2/22: Is Wichita State really on the wrong side of the NCAA tourney bubble?"
- Parish started off by giving a little back story on where Wichita State is at in their season, giving their record and some of their win statistics.
- He then set Norlander up to speak by asking him a question, "What do you do with this Wichita State team if you're on the committee?"
- Norlander answers, and then it leads to a discussion between the two.  
- At one point they talk about a game that is going to be played the night of the podcast.  They game they were discussing was going to be aired on CBS, so they made sure to say this, since the podcast was on from CBS.
- Over half of the podcast was spent talking about Wichita State, but then the hosts transitioned into talking about other games.
- They quickly went over the games that had already been played since the last podcast aired, and then they discussed the upcoming games and how they could impact the NCAA tournament.
#### 2/19: Calipari call out; Bill Self should be in HOF; Virginia concerns; Michigan State bad luck
- This episode started like all the others with the music and short introduction.
- Then, Parish gets right into the heart of their discussion and says that NC State's head coach has just been fired.
- Parish then asks Norlander, "what are your thoughts on NC State's decision to change coaches?".
- Norlander gives his answer, then it leads to
- Norlander once said in discussion, "do you remember what I said in our last podcast?" and Parish jokingly responded with, "no, I don't listen to what you say most of the time."  It added a humorous moment to their discussion, and really made it sound as if it were just two friends talking about sports.
- They stayed pretty close to the topics that the title said they would be speaking about, along with discussing past scores and upcoming games.
